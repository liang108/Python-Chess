This is my implementation of the classic game of chess in Python. It uses pygame to implement an interactive GUI.

Notes:
* Play requires declaring starting square and ending square.
* The pieces have logic and will check that a specified move is legal.
* The images are stored locally. In this repository, they're stored in the "Resized" directory. Their pathways are specified in their class definitions.
* The board has fixed dimensions (691 x 691).
* The chess.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook with all the class definitions and game loop put together so it can be run as a single file (requires Pygame install).
